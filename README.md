This system is made for 22 EEG electrodes in 10-20 positioning standard. The system curently works only with .edf files.

Clone the repository to a local directory 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/JanevaD/eegdepressiondetection
```

Run
```
depressiondetection.py
```
In ```.edf``` file you can find examples of eeg signals in .edf format. Test the system as shown in the video.
